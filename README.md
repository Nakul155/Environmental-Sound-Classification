# Environmental-Sound-Classification

Environmental sound classification involves distinguishing between various types of sounds like car horns, rain, or dog barks using machine learning models. In this study, we explore the performance of a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) when trained on three different audio features: MFCC, STFT, and Gammatone filterbanks.
